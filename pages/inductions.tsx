            RoboKnights is back with its annual induction process, this time
            even more INTERESTING!
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed dark:text-gray-c8">
            Many think that Robotics is limited to those having proficiency in
            creativity and science, while we agree that these skills are
            helpful, and admit that we are looking for them, we also believe
            that enthusiasm and dedication are arguably more important, as they
            are the qualities that inspire learners and make the projects more
            efficient. This yearâ€™s inductions will not require any prerequisites
            apart from a very small percentage from the resources provided
            below. An orientation session will be held to acquaint the students
            about the same.
